I am a temporary Researcher and Lecturer (ATER) at Université Lumière Lyon 2. I recently completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics, with a thesis titles "Mixed data temporal clustering for modelling longitudinal survey". My research focuses on developing novel statistical and computational approaches to analyze complex, time-varying datasets that combine continuous, categorical and count variables. This work has potential applications in healthcare, social sciences and behavioral research where understanding patterns over time is crucial.

## Research Interests
- Clustering
- Temporal data
- Mixed-type data
